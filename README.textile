Gloss is a byte-format DSL.  It can turn complicated byte formats into Clojure data structures, allowing for easy use of custom network protocols and C libraries.  It can also turn Clojure data structures into compact byte representations, allowing for efficient use of bandwidth and disk.

It is a work in progress.
